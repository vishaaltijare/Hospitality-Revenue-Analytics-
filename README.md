Hospitality Analytics Dashboard — Power BI

**Overview**
This project showcases a dynamic Power BI dashboard developed to analyze booking and revenue performance across a 40-property hotel portfolio in 5 Indian cities. Using over 200,000 records, the dashboard enables detailed tracking of occupancy, ADR, revenue, and booking patterns, empowering hotel managers to uncover underperforming properties, optimize pricing, and improve platform/channel efficiency.

Power Query – Data transformation, cleaning, and preparation
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Calculated columns, measures (e.g., RevPAR, ADR, Occupancy %), and time intelligence logic
Star Schema Modeling – Structured with 1 fact and 4 dimension tables

**Key Metrics & Insights**
RevPAR (Revenue per Available Room), ADR (Average Daily Rate), and Occupancy % across cities, room types, and platforms
Realization % and Cancellation Rate to assess booking fulfillment
Top/Bottom Performing Hotels by revenue and occupancy
Channel Efficiency – Analyze performance by booking platform
