Hospitality Analytics Dashboard — Power BI

**Overview**

This project showcases a dynamic Power BI dashboard developed to analyze booking and revenue performance across a 40-property hotel portfolio in 5 Indian cities. Using over 200,000 records, the dashboard enables detailed tracking of occupancy, ADR, revenue, and booking patterns, empowering hotel managers to uncover underperforming properties, optimize pricing, and improve platform/channel efficiency.
